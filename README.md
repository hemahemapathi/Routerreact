1. Description :
       
    This project is a React application that implements navigation using `react-router-dom`, based on the design and layout of the [GUVI Blog](https://www.guvi.in/blog). The application features a navigation menu for different courses like Full Stack Development, Data Science, Cyber Security, and Career. Each menu item routes to a static page with content relevant to the selected course.

2. Requirements :

   - Implement a navigation menu for courses similar to the one found in the middle of the GUVI Blog page.
   - Use `react-router-dom` to create routes for each course.
   - Each course page should display static content as provided.

3. Usage :

   - Open your browser and go to ` http://localhost:5174/`.
   - Use the navigation menu to switch between different course pages.

4. Technologies Used :

   - **React**: For building the user interface.
   - **React Router DOM**: For handling routing.
